Results got during my testing of the first part of the final project:

Im using 3 different species to test results on each subpage:
    - Homo sapiens
    - Mus Musculus
    - Danio rerio

Test results of list of species:
    - No argument(textbox empty) ==> 199 species (each numbered) and a link to the main page.
    - 15 ==> 15 species (form Mouse to Microbat) each one numbered and a link to the main page.
    - 150000 ==> 199 species (from Mouse to Microbat) each one numbered and a link to the main page.

Test results of karyotype:
    - Empty textbox (default: Homo sapiens) ==> 25 chromosomes, 1-22 in respective order, 23 = X, 24 = Y, 25 = MT. A link to the main page below.
    - Mus musculus ==> 22 chromosomes, 1-19 in respective order, 20 = X, 21 = Y, 22 = MT. A link to the main page below.
    - Danio rerio ==> 26 chromosomes, 1-25 in respective order, 26 = MT. A link to the main page below.

Test results for chromosome length:
    - Specie: Homo Sapiens, Chromosome: 8. Resulting on the following number, 145138636. A Link to the main page below.
    - Specie: Mus musculus, chromosome: 15. Resulting on the following number, 104043685. A link to the main page below.
    - Specie: Danio rerio, Chromosome: 25. Resulting on the following number, 37502051. A link to the main page below.

Endpoints:
    - / ==> Main page. As well as /Index.html.
    - /listSpecies ==> Page to list vertebrates in the Ensembl database(first link)
    - /karyotype ==> Page to consult number of chromosomes of a species (second link)
    - /chromosomeLength ==> page to consult length of a given chromosome in a species (third link)
    - Any typo (excluding letter casing) ends in the error page with a link to the main page.
